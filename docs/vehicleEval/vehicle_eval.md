# Vehicle Evaluation

AERO McGill evaluates different airframes and vehicle configurations
based on the intended mission and application. In practice, UAVs are
commonly grouped in three classes

>   * Multicopters: Versatile, manoeuvrable, and capable of precise
>     hovering, but limited in endurance or range
>   * Fixed-Wings: Traditional planes are very efficient, and can easily
>     achieve high speed or long distance flight
>   * VTOLs: Vertical-Takeoff-Or-Landing aircraft combines the benefits
>     of fixed-wing planes and multicopters
