GPS and Compass
---------------
Connect the output port of the GPS module to the GPS port of the autopilot using a 6-wire cable. 

	.. note:: Some GPS modules are matched to a specific type of autopilot. e.g. the HERE GNSS is matched to the Pixhawk 2.1; It should only be connected to the Pixhawk 2.1's GPS1 port.

	 
Most GPS modules have an integral compass. Position the GPS module at a distance from other electronics to reduce magnetic interference on the compass. Mount the GPS module with the heading mark arrow pointing towards the front of the vehicle.
