Telemetry Radio
---------------

Connect the output of a telemetry radio to the telem 1 port of the autopilot using a 6-wire cable. 

Telemetry is used to monitor vehicle status in flight and send commands to the vehicle from a ground station, i.e. guide the vehicle to a position on a map, or upload a mission. 

	.. warning:: When using a high power radio modem, such as the RFD900 modem, only connect the 4 signal wires to the Autopilot. Connect the power and ground wires to a separate BEC that can supply at least 3A.
