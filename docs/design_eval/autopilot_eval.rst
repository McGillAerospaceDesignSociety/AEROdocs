Autopilot Hardware
------------------
Pixhawk series autopilots all run PX4 or ArduPilot firmware, but the hardware differ in interfaces and form factor. This section summarizes the available autopilot hardware and groups them into three categories.

General purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are full-feature autopilots with a full set of interfaces, i.e. 8+6 Main and Aux outputs, 5 serial ports, analog ports. They are suitable for a wide range of airframes and configurations. They can further be categorized by their intended applications.

-	Industrial / Commercial

These are well tested and widely available at a reasonable price. They are optimized for easy deployment on industrial or professional UAVs. 

	-	Pixhawk
	-	Pixhawk 2.1
	-	mRobotics X2.1

-	Academic / Research

These are computationally powerful and feature-rich, and accordingly more expensive. They are good platforms for developing bleeding-edge capabilities

	-	Pixhawk 3 Pro
	-	Pixhawk 4

Miniaturized
~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are small and lightweight autopilots with reduced interfaces. They are suitable for space-constrained configurations, e.g. FPV racers. 

	-	Pixhawk Mini
	-	Pixracer

Derivative
~~~~~~~~~~
These are derivatives of one of the above designs. They are less well tested, but retain the set of features and capabilities of their parent design

	-	Dropix
	-	Pixhack
	-	MindPX

	.. warning:: Exotic designs are excluded from this list. It is the end-userâ€™s responsibility to find them and verify their capabilities.
