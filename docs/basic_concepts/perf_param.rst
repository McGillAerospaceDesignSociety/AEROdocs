System Performance Parameters
=============================


Vehicle Performance
-------------------

Thrust-to-Weight Ratio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thrust-to-weight ratio is the ratio of total thrust to the vehicle weight. It is an indicator of the speed the vehicle can achieve and its maximum weight.


Power Loading (G/W efficiency)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Power loading refers to the ratio of thrust delivered to the power input. It is a commonly used benchmark of motor and propeller efficiency. 

For better intuition, thrust is measured by grams. 

Propeller Performance
---------------------
Main propeller performance parameters are thrust and torque. They are modelled by

.. math::
	
	T = k_T \rho n^2 D^4 \\
	Q = k_Q \rho n^2 D^5
