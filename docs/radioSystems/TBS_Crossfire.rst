TBS Crossfire
=============

DragonLink is a UHF RC system. Compared to other UHF systems, its primary advantage is its support for the CRSF protocol, which offers a very low latency control link with integral telemetry data downlink.

TBS Crossfire has support for bidirectional telemetry, including MAVLink telemetry for ArduPilot, but this functionality is limited by the low downlink transmit power on Receivers.
