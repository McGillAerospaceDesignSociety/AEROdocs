Multicopter Airframes
=====================

A multicopter is an Aerial Vehicle that achieves flight using multiple
motors that drive propellers to provide thrust. It can be controlled and
stabilized in flight by adjusting the speeds of the motors.

As discussed in the Vehicle Evaluation section, multicopters are suitable for aerial photography, surveying, and many other roles that
require hovering, precise maneuvering, or heavy lifting. Additionally, multicopters are mechanically simple and easy to construct, which leads
to many airframe configurations that are further optimized for a role.

Mount and Orient Autopilot
--------------------------

The autopilot should be positioned as close to the vehicleâ€™s center of gravity as possible. Ideally, the autopilot should be mounted in the standard orientation, indicated by the heading mark arrow pointing out the front/nose of the vehicle. 

.. note::
   To mount the autopilot in a non-standard orientation, reconfigure the autopilot parameter AHRS_ORIENTATION to recognize the new orientation. This adjusts sensors readings to realign with the vehicle.

Vibration Isolation
-------------------

The autopilot should be mounted on vibration absorbing material, which isolates the sensitive sensors from vibrations. Soft foam such as 3M Autopilot Damping Foams, gel pads, and mounting tables with rubber damping balls are effective in vibration isolation.
