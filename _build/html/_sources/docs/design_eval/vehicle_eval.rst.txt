Vehicle Evaluation
==================

AERO McGill evaluates different airframes and vehicle configurations
based on the intended mission and application. In practice, UAVs are
commonly grouped in three classes

    -  Multicopters: Versatile, manoeuvrable, and capable of precise hovering, but limited in endurance or range
    -  Fixed-Wings: Traditional planes are very efficient, and can easily achieve high speed or long distance flight
    -  VTOLs: Vertical-Takeoff-Or-Landing aircraft combines the benefits of fixed-wing planes and multicopters


Multicopter Design
------------------

The UAV designer or builder should define the purpose or role of the multicopter as early as possible. From the vehicle purpose or role, the designer can estimate important performance parameters, including:

- Endurance and range
- Speed and agility
- Payload capacity

On the other hand, a well defined role also allows the designer to compare the current design to common classes of multicopters. This is useful for identifying reference designs and approximating the flight envelope of the current design. 

For example, taking the 3DR Solo as the reference point for an aerial photography drone shows that 12-inch propellers are optimal; a vehicle designed to accommodate 8-inch propellers would be underpowered.

Propulsion System
-----------------

In the multicopter design process, the propulsion system must be considered first.  

A multicopter must achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of at least 2:1 at full throttle, such that the vehicle may hover at approximately 50% throttle. Not meeting this requirement will result in a vehicle that is hard to control in wind and poorly maneuverable. 

Propellers
~~~~~~~~~~
The design parameters of propellers are size (diameter), pitch, and configuration. The following design rules generally apply

1. A larger propeller, i.e. greater diameter, delivers more thrust. 
2. For given thrust output, a larger propeller achieves better propulsive efficiency. 
3. A propeller with greater pitch delivers more thrust, but is also less efficient and consumes more power when driven

In the design process, the first constraint for propellers is that the propeller must deliver enough thrust to achieve a predefined thrust-to-weight ratio, minimally 2:1. Once this is satisfied, the desginer should selected the largest propeller permitted by the airframe to optimize for efficiency.
