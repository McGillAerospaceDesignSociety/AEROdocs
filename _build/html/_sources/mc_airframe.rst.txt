Multicopter Airframes
=====================

A multicopter is an Aerial Vehicle that achieves flight using multiple motors that drive propellers to provide thrust. It can be controlled and stabilized in flight by adjusting the speeds of the motors. 

As discussed in the Vehicle Evaluation section, multicopters are suitable for aerial photography, surveying, and many other roles that require hovering, precise maneuvering, or heavy lifting. Additionally, multicopters are mechanically simple and easy to construct, which leads to many airframe configurations that are further optimized for a role.

Single/Coaxcopter
-----------------
Singlecopters and coaxcopters have less than three motors that provide thrust. Currently, they are mostly experimental designs that usually excel in terms of flight dynamics or efficiency. 

*Single/Coaxcopters are efficient because their airframe accomodates a single large propeller; Propeller efficiency increases with prop diameter*

* Single/Coaxcopters may rely on rotor pitch control or control serfaces to achieve control and stability. 
* Their flight dynamics are somewhat complex but can still be realized on many autopilot systems
* They are actively developed by many research institutes that seek to exploit their efficiency advantage

Tricopter
---------

The Tricopter has 3 motors typically arranged in a Y pattern. The rear motor is attached to a servo, which can tilt to provide yaw control to the Tricopter.

* Tricopters are the simplest type of multicopter that still enjoy uncomplicated flight dynamics
* They were popular earlier when motors were less reliable
* Their stability and performance is often limited by control resolution, positional accuracy, and update rate of the servomechanism

Quadcopter
----------
The quadcopter has 4 motors, which can be arranged symmetrically in various geometric layouts. 

* Quadcopters enjoy both mechanical simplicity and simple flight dynamics 
* Their primary drawback is a lack of redundancy, as failure of even one single motor will cause total loss of control. 

Quadcopter X
............
4 motors arranged in a X pattern and 4 frame arms linked to center of the vehicle. This makes for a largely symmetric vehicle that further simplifies control for pilots or flight controllers. This is the most common layout.

Quadcopter Wide
...............
4 motors arranged in a X pattern but front motors are spaced further apart. The greater separation between motors give a wide field of view to a forward looking camera. 

This configuration also shift the center of thrust to the rear of the vehicle, which allows heavy batteries to be carried at the back of the vehicle.

Quadcopter H
............
4 motors arranged in a X pattern but frame arms are built from horizontal booms fixed in the front and the back of the vehicle. This is an very robust configuration, and is especially easy to construct with basic tools.

.. Tip::
	Frame arms can be constructed from continuous carbon-fiber tubes or PVC tubes

Quadcopter Plus
...............
4 motors arranged in a plus (+) pattern. This configuration is uncommon because the front motor blocks the view of forward looking cameras. However, some modern racing quadcopters are adopting this configuration due to its exceptional pitch control.

Hexa/Octocopter
---------------
The hexacopter has six motors, while the octocopter has eight. Motors are arranged symmetrically and frame arms are linked to center of the vehicle. 


* Hexa/Octocopters are stable heavy-lifting platforms widely used for aerial photography and agricultural applications
* They enjoy motor redundancy which allows vehicle to remain under control after one motor is disabled
* Their primary drawback is their somewhat lower efficiency, hence they are not suitable for long-range or high-speed applications

Y6/H8 hexa/octocopter
---------------------
The Y6/X8 are reconfigurations of hexacopters and octocopters respectively. The Y6 uses 4 pairs of coaxially mounted motors arranged in a Y pattern, while the X8 uses 4 pairs arranged in a X pattern

* Y6/X8 hexa/octocopters are very stable
* These are geometrically compact configurations, requiring half as many frame arms, that makes for greater robustness and higher payload capacity
* They suffer from an approximately 10% penalty in propulsive efficiency compared to a hexacopter or octocopter.

Multicopter Airframe Rating
---------------------------
Multicopter airframes are usually rated by the distance between diametrically opposite motors. For example, a racing copter with the front left motor and rear right motor separated by 250 mm is rated 250.
