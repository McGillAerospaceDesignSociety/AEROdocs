Vehicle Evaluation
==================

AERO McGill evaluates different airframes and vehicle configurations based on the intended mission and application. In practice, UAVs are commonly grouped in three classes

 - Multicopters: Versatile, manoeuvrable, and capable of precise hovering, but limited in endurance or range

 - Fixed-Wings: Traditional planes are very efficient, and can easily achieve high speed or long distance flight

 - VTOLs: Vertical-Takeoff-Or-Landing aircraft combines the benefits of fixed-wing planes and multicopters

## VTOLs
VTOL aircraft usually combine a multicopter configuration with wings to achieve Vertical-Takeoff-Or-Landing while retaining the efficiency of fixed-wings.

### Tailsitter
The tailsitter mounts two tractor motors on a flying wing. In fixed-wing mode, they fly like a simple twin-engine plane. In multicopter mode, the flying wing is oriented vertically, such that the motors thrust up for lift, and the wing ailerons redirect slipstream air for lateral control.

* Mechanically simplest way to achieve Vertical-Takeoff-Or-Landing.
* Primary drawback is unwieldiness: They take off nose vertically up but flies level, making payload mounting very complicated

### Tiltrotor
The tiltrotor mounts two motors that can tilt up, plus one tail motor to provide stabilization during the motor-tilting process. Short wings provide lift during forward-flight.

* Efficient and versatile VTOL configuration that combines many valuable features of multicopters and planes
* Primary drawback is unreliability: The tiltrotor mechanism is complex, and the VTOL transition, during which the motor tilts, is hard to control

### Quadplane
The quadplane mounts four motors in a Quadcopter X configurations to a fixed wing plane, which also has a motor for propulsion

* Most reliable VTOL configuration that uses no moving actuators or changing vehicle orientation in flight.
* Primary drawback is inefficiency: quadcopter motors are useless in fixed-wing mode, and plane motor is useless in multicopter mode
